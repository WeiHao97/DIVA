This directory corresponds to section 6 of the paper.

Since the case study practiced the full path of: dataset generation, model generation, attack generation on both server and edge, evaluation of top-1/top-5 scores and confidence delta, and graph generation for visualization, we decided to upload the full artifacts used in this section. You can download the structured zip file through this link: "*****todo******"

The zip file includes:

-The weights for:
    - full-presicion model 
    - QAT model 
    - tflite model 
-Raw PubFig Dataset with face croped.
-Pre-processed Dataset for testing the instability between the fp model and the quantized model.
-Pre-processed Dataset for evaluating DIVA and PGD attack.
-Resulting data corresponding to the paper that can be visualized using '*****todo******'

- Workflows of untargeted and trageted attack can be found in corresponding sub-folders.
