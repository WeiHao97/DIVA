Within the evaluation jupyter notebooks, we will cover the results of Section 5.2. We used the same notebook to evaluate all of the attacks (PGD, DIVA, SemiBB) on all of the models (ResNet, MobileNet, DenseNet) using the same evaluation notebook. Within this notebook we will:

-  Calculate the basic statistics of top1/top5 success rate, time taken and steps taken. 
-  Calculation of the Stability graph (Figure 1).
-  Calculation of the Confidence deltas.
-  Calculation DSSIM data statistics.
